# Network Room Manager

**Please see the Room example in the Examples folder in your Mirror folder.**

The Network Room Manager is a specialized type of [Network Manager](network-manager.md) that provides a multiplayer room before entering the main play scene of the game. It allows you to set up a network with:

- A maximum player limit
- Automatic start when all players are ready
- Game is locked after start, preventing late joiners
- Customizable ways for players to choose options while in room

There are two types of player objects with the Network Room Manager:

**Room Player Prefab**

- One for each player
- Created when client connects, or player is added
- Persists until client disconnects
- Holds ready flag and configuration data
- Handles commands in the room
- Must use the [Network Room Player](network-room-player.md) component

**Player Prefab**

- One for each player
- Created when game scene is started
- Destroyed when leaving game scene
- Handles commands in the game
